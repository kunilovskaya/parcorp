Submitted by the Working Party on General Safety Provisions /
The text reproduced below was adopted by the Working Party on General Safety (GRSG) at its ninety-seventh session to improve the provisions concerning the obstruction created by the steering-wheel rim and the instrument panel inside the steering wheel.
It is based on informal document GRSG-97-25 as reproduced in Annex VI to the report (ECE/TRANS/WP.29/GRSG/76, para. 37).
It is submitted to the World Forum for Harmonization of Vehicle Regulations (WP.29) and to the Administrative Committee (AC.1) for consideration.

Paragraph 5.1.3., amend to read
"5.1.3 Except as provided in 5.1.3.1 or 5.1.3.2., other than the obstructions created by the A pillars, the fixed or movable vent or side window division bars, outside radio aerials, rear-view mirrors and windscreen wipers, there should be no obstruction in the driver's 180° forward direct field of vision below a horizontal plane passing through V1, and above three planes through V2, one being perpendicular to the plane XZ and declining forward 4° below the horizontal, and the other two being perpendicular to the plane YZ and declining 4° below the horizontal (see Annex 4, appendix, figure 4)."
Insert a new paragraph 5.1.3.2., to read:
An obstruction between a plane through V2, and declined at least 1° below the horizontal and a plane through V2 and declined 4° below the horizontal will be tolerated if the conical projection of this obstruction, starting from V2, on an area "S" as defined in paragraph 5.1.3.2.1. does not exceed 20 per cent of this area.
The steering wheel, if adjustable, shall be placed in the normal position indicated by the manufacturer or, failing that, midway between the limits of its range(s) of adjustment."
Insert new paragraphs 5.1.3.2.1. and 5.1.3.2.2., to read :
The area "S" (see Annex 4, Appendix, figure 7) is a rectangular vertical area located in a plane perpendicular to the X coordinate 1,500 mm forward of the point V2.
The upper edge of the area "S" is defined by a plane passing through V2 declined forward 1° below the horizontal.
The lower edge of the area 'S' is defined by a plane passing through V2 declined forward 4° below the horizontal.
The left and right edges of the area "S" are vertical and generated from the intersection lines of the three planes declined 4° as defined in paragraph 5.1.2.2. above.
In the case of a windscreen extending beyond 1,500 mm forward of the point V2, the distance between the area "S" and the point V2 may be extended accordingly."
Annex 4, Appendix, insert a new figure 7, to read:
