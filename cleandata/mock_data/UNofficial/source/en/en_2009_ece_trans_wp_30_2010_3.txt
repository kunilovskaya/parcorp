Revision of the Convention Amendment proposals for the Convention Note by the secretariat At its 123rd session, the Working Party reviewed the text of the amendment proposals to Annex 9, Part I, contained in Informal document WP.30 No. 6 (2009), with a slightly amended wording for Article 3 (vi) proposed by the secretariat.
After extensive discussion, the Working Party decided that the above provision should read: "provide the TIR Executive Board annually, as per 1 March, with the price of each type of TIR Carnets it issues."
IRU reiterated its opposition to this proposal.
Finally, the Working Party requested the secretariat to submit the amendment proposals in the appropriate format as an official document in all working languages for adoption at its next session (ECE/TRANS/WP.30/246, paragraph 28).
