Pending issues Limited quantities Transmitted by the secretariat of the Intergovernmental Organization for International Carriage by Rail (OTIF),
1. At the last Joint Meeting (Bern, 8 - 11 September 2009, and Geneva, 14 - 18 September 2009), it was decided to harmonise Chapter 3.4 of RID/ADR/ADN fully with Chapter 3.4 of the UN Model Regulations on the Transport of Dangerous Goods and to reflect the quantity information of the UN Model Regulations in Chapter 3.2, Table A, column (7a) (see report OTIF/RID/RC/2009-B - ECE/TRANS/WP.15/ AC.1/116, paragraphs 86 - 91).
2. The following amendment to column (7a) of Table A is given in the texts adopted by the Joint Meeting (OTIF/RID/RC/2009-B/Add.1 - ECE/TRANS/WP.15/ AC.1/116/Add.1):
"In column (7a), add the maximum quantity per inner packaging or article for carrying dangerous goods as limited quantities, as given in Chapter 3.2 of the UN
Recommendations on the Transport of Dangerous Goods, Model Regulations, sixteenth revised edition (document ST/SG/AC.10/1/Rev.16).".
3 When incorporating this amendment into Table A, it emerged that the instructions for this amendment are not precise enough and must therefore be modified in order to exclude any doubt.
4. The instruction for the amendment should read as follows:
"In column (7a), add the maximum quantity per inner packaging or article for carrying dangerous goods as limited quantities, as given in Chapter 3.2 of the UN Recommendations on the Transport of Dangerous Goods, Model Regulations, sixteenth revised edition (document ST/SG/AC.10/1/Rev.16), with the following exceptions:
